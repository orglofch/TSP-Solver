TSP-Solver
============

Two variation of a travelling salesman problem solver.
1. A* Search - (Slow, Accurate)
2. Simulated Annealing - (Fast, Approximation)

Language: C++

Libraries: None

1. A* Search

   Mostly implemented for the sake of proving the benefits of simulated annealing.
   
   Uses the **minimum spanning tree** for the heuristic cost (via Kruskals algorithm).
   
   The runtime becomes intractable even for problems with 36 cities.

2. Simulated Annealing
    
    Neighbouring states are generated by swapping two city ids in the current city tour
    other than the end. When comparing states we either select the new state (if
    it has a smaller cost) or select the new state according to a **Boltzmann probablity**.

   Severall cooling schedules were considered, the exponential temerature decrease performed
   the best in practice.
